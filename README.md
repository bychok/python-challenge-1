# Variety Food Truck Ordering System

## Introduction

This project is an interactive ordering system for a variety food truck, designed to provide a seamless ordering experience for customers. Utilizing Python, this script allows customers to view a menu, select items, specify quantities, and view a final order summary including the total price.

## Features

- Interactive menu browsing by categories: Snacks, Meals, Drinks, and Desserts.
- Detailed selection options for items, including size and type where applicable.
- Dynamic order summary that calculates and displays the total cost.

## How It Works

The system prompts the user to choose from various menu categories. Once a category is selected, the customer can view items within that category and input their choice by specifying the item's number. If applicable, the customer can choose from further options (such as size or type for drinks and pizzas). After selecting an item, they can indicate the desired quantity. This process can be repeated for multiple items. The session ends with the printing of a complete order summary, including the total cost.

### Menu Dictionary

The menu is structured as a nested dictionary, with top-level keys representing categories and second-level keys representing item names. Prices are listed as values, with further nested dictionaries used for items offering additional options.

### Order Process

- Upon launching, customers are greeted and prompted to select a category.
- After selecting a category and item, customers are asked to specify quantities.
- Customers can then choose to add more items or complete their order.
- A match-case statement handles customer responses throughout the ordering process.
- The order summary is generated by looping through the collected order data.

## Technology

- **Language**: Python
- **Data Structures**: Lists, Dictionaries
- **Control Structures**: Loops, Conditional Statements, Match-Case Statements

## Setup and Execution

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `menu.py` file.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter (Python 3.x is recommended).

## Project Structure

- `menu.py`: Main Python script for the ordering system.

## Conclusion

This project showcases basic Python programming techniques to create a functional and user-friendly ordering system for a variety food truck. It demonstrates the use of nested data structures and control flow mechanisms to process user inputs and manage complex data interactions.

## Future Improvements

- Implementation of a GUI for a more interactive user experience.
- Addition of payment processing functionality.
- Expansion of the menu and customization options.
